        description: "An anomaly is an unusual or unexpected phenomenon occurring in a specific location, often marked by distinct features that set it apart from its surroundings. \nThese anomalies can vary widely in nature, encompassing unexplained structures, irregular patterns, or significant deviations from expected environmental norms. \nEach anomaly is characterized by its unique coordinates, typically represented by an 'x' and 'y' position, and is associated with a particular world or environment, such as a planet or celestial body. \nAnomalies often invite exploration and investigation due to their mysterious origins and potential insights into the environment or history of the world they inhabit. \nThey may be captured visually through imagery, providing observers with a glimpse into their peculiar characteristics. \nWhether natural or artificial in origin, anomalies remain key subjects of curiosity, serving as focal points for research, storytelling, and discovery."
